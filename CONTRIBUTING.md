# Contributing

This package is open to contributions big and small.

To contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the upstream repository and clone the fork locally.
2. Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), and install the project's dependencies with `poetry install`
3. Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) by running `pre-commit install`
4. Make whatever changes and additions you wish and commit these - please try to keep your commit history clean.
5. Note: 100% tests are mandatory.
6. Once you are ready, add a PR in the main repo
7. Create a pull request to the main repository with an explanation of your changes

__NOTE__: The test suite requires having an instance of MongoDB available. You can launch one using the root level
docker-compose config with `docker-compose up --detach`, or by any other means you deem.
